# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly. The specific problem involves a `hover` pseudo-class that doesn't trigger the expected style change.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code snippet. The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected code and explanation.

## Problem
The `hover:bg-blue-700` class should change the background color on hover, but it does not. This is likely due to an error in either Tailwind's configuration or the way the classes are being used.
